## üîê Authentication Flow

- **Principal**: `priya.sharma@dypsn.edu` / `demo123` (Full admin access)
- **Director**: `rajesh.patel@dypsn.edu` / `demo123` (Full admin access)

## üìä Database Structure

### Student Collections

#### 1. Main Users Collection (`users`)
All students are stored in the main users collection for authentication and general access.

#### 2. Organized Collections (`students/{year}/{sem}/{div}`)
Students are automatically organized into hierarchical collections by:
- **Year**: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th
- **Semester**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- **Division**: A, B, C, D

**Collection Path**: `students/{year}/{sem}/{div}/{rollNumber}`

**Example**: `students/2nd/3/A/CS001`

#### Student Document Structure
```typescript
{
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  name: string;                  // Full name
  email: string;                 // Email address
  phone?: string;                // Phone number
  gender?: string;               // Gender
  employeeId?: string;           // Roll number (used as document ID in organized collection)
  year?: string;                 // Year (1st/2nd/3rd/4th)
  sem?: string;                  // Semester (1-8)
  div?: string;                  // Division (A/B/C/D)
  department: string;            // Department
  role: 'student';               // Always 'student'
  accessLevel: 'basic';          // Always 'basic'
  isActive: boolean;             // Account status
  createdAt: string;             // Creation timestamp
  lastLogin?: string;            // Last login timestamp
  loginCount?: number;           // Login count

- Include required fields (name, email, rollNumber)

### 3. **Student Organization**
- Use consistent naming for years and semesters
- Maintain proper division assignments
- Keep department names consistent

### 4. **Security**

- **Teacher users**: Add and import students in their department (view, add, import, export, no edit/delete)
- Students cannot modify their own data
- All changes are logged in Firestore

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. **Import Fails**
- Check Excel file format (.xlsx or .xls)

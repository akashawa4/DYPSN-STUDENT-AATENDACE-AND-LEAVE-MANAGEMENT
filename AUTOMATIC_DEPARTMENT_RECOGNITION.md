# Automatic Department Recognition & Faculty Assignment System

## Overview

The CSE Attendance and Leave Management System now includes intelligent automatic department recognition for both students and teachers, along with automatic assignment of student leave requests to the appropriate department faculty. This ensures seamless data organization and proper workflow management.

## üéØ **Key Features**

### **1. Automatic Department Detection**
- ‚úÖ **Student Department Recognition**: Automatically detects student departments from existing Firestore data
- ‚úÖ **Teacher Department Recognition**: Automatically detects teacher departments from existing Firestore data
- ‚úÖ **Fallback Detection**: Searches department-based collections if direct department field is missing
- ‚úÖ **Smart Defaults**: Defaults to CSE department if no department information is found

### **2. Automatic Faculty Assignment**
- ‚úÖ **Department Head Priority**: Leave requests are automatically assigned to department heads
- ‚úÖ **Faculty Fallback**: If no department head, assigns to first available faculty member
- ‚úÖ **Notification System**: Automatically creates notifications for assigned faculty
- ‚úÖ **Complete Faculty List**: Maintains list of all department faculty for reference

### **3. Intelligent Data Organization**
- ‚úÖ **Auto-Save to Department Structure**: Automatically saves users to correct department collections
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Collection Search**: Searches multiple collections to find existing department data
- ‚úÖ **Data Consistency**: Ensures all related data is properly organized by department

## üîÑ **How It Works**

### **1. Automatic Department Detection Process**

#### **For Students:**
```typescript
// 1. Check main user document for department field
const userData = await getDoc(userRef);
if (userData.department || userData.dept) {
  return getDepartment(userData);
}

// 2. Search department-based collections for existing data
for (const dept of Object.values(DEPARTMENTS)) {
  const batchPath = buildBatchPath.student('2025', dept, '3', 'A');
  const studentRef = doc(db, batchPath, userId);
  if (await getDoc(studentRef).exists()) {
    return dept; // Found existing data in this department
  }
}

// 3. Default to CSE if no department found
return DEPARTMENTS.CSE;
```

#### **For Teachers:**
```typescript
// 1. Check main teacher document for department field
const teacherData = await getDoc(teacherRef);
if (teacherData.department || teacherData.dept || teacherData.assignedDepartment) {
  return getTeacherDepartment(teacherData);
}

// 2. Search department-based collections for existing data
for (const dept of Object.values(DEPARTMENTS)) {
  const batchPath = buildBatchPath.teacher('2025', dept, '3', 'A');
  const teacherRef = doc(db, batchPath, userId);
  if (await getDoc(teacherRef).exists()) {
    return dept; // Found existing data in this department
  }
}

// 3. Default to CSE if no department found
return DEPARTMENTS.CSE;
```

### **2. Faculty Assignment Process**

#### **Department Faculty Discovery:**
```typescript
// 1. Search all department-based teacher collections
for (const batch of ['2025', '2026', '2027', '2028']) {
  for (const sem of ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8']) {
    for (const div of ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']) {
      const batchPath = buildBatchPath.teacher(batch, department, sem, div);
      const teachersSnapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, batchPath));
      // Collect all faculty members
    }
  }
}

// 2. Also check main teachers collection
const teachersQuery = query(
  collection(db, COLLECTIONS.TEACHERS),
  where('department', '==', department),
  where('role', '==', 'teacher')
);
```

#### **Department Head Assignment:**
```typescript
// 1. First check for department head/coordinator
const teachersQuery = query(
  collection(db, COLLECTIONS.TEACHERS),
  where('department', '==', department),
  where('role', '==', 'teacher'),
  where('isDepartmentHead', '==', true)
);

// 2. If no department head, get first available faculty
const faculty = await getDepartmentFaculty(department);
const assignedTo = departmentHead || (faculty.length > 0 ? faculty[0] : null);
```

### **3. Leave Request Assignment Process**

#### **Automatic Assignment:**
```typescript
// 1. Auto-detect student department
let dept = department;
if (!dept) {
  dept = await autoDetectDepartment(userId, 'student');
}

// 2. Get department faculty
const departmentFaculty = await getDepartmentFaculty(dept);
const departmentHead = await getDepartmentHead(dept);

// 3. Assign to department head or first faculty
const assignedTo = departmentHead || (departmentFaculty.length > 0 ? departmentFaculty[0] : null);

// 4. Update leave request with assignment
await updateDoc(docRef, {
  department: dept,
  assignedTo: assignedTo ? {
    id: assignedTo.id,
    name: assignedTo.name,
    email: assignedTo.email,
    role: assignedTo.isDepartmentHead ? 'Department Head' : 'Faculty'
  } : null,
  departmentFaculty: departmentFaculty.map(f => ({
    id: f.id,
    name: f.name,
    email: f.email,
    role: f.isDepartmentHead ? 'Department Head' : 'Faculty'
  }))
});

// 5. Create notification for assigned faculty
if (assignedTo) {
  await createLeaveNotification(assignedTo.id, docRef.id, leaveData, dept);
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **New Helper Functions**

### **1. Department Detection Functions**
```typescript
// Auto-detect department from existing Firestore data
export const autoDetectDepartment = async (
  userId: string, 
  role: 'student' | 'teacher'
): Promise<string>

// Get department from teacher data
export const getTeacherDepartment = (teacherData: any): string

// Get department faculty for leave approval
export const getDepartmentFaculty = async (department: string): Promise<any[]>

// Get department head or coordinator
export const getDepartmentHead = async (department: string): Promise<any | null>
```

### **2. Enhanced User Service**
```typescript
// Automatically detects and assigns departments
async createUser(userData: User): Promise<void> {
  // Auto-detect department if not provided
  let department = userData.department || (userData as any).dept;
  if (!department) {
    department = await autoDetectDepartment(userData.id, 'student');
    console.log(`Auto-detected department for student ${userData.id}: ${department}`);
  }
  
  // Save to department-based structure
  const batchPath = buildBatchPath.student(batch, department, userData.sem, userData.div);
  // ... save user data
}
```

### **3. Enhanced Leave Service**
```typescript
// Automatically assigns leave requests to department faculty
async createLeaveRequest(leaveData: Omit<LeaveRequest, 'id'>): Promise<string> {
  // Auto-detect department
  let dept = department;
  if (!dept) {
    dept = await autoDetectDepartment(userId, 'student');
  }
  
  // Get department faculty and assign
  const departmentFaculty = await getDepartmentFaculty(dept);
  const departmentHead = await getDepartmentHead(dept);
  const assignedTo = departmentHead || (departmentFaculty.length > 0 ? departmentFaculty[0] : null);
  
  // Update leave request with assignment
  await updateDoc(docRef, {
    department: dept,
    assignedTo: assignedTo ? { /* faculty details */ } : null,
    departmentFaculty: departmentFaculty.map(f => ({ /* faculty list */ }))
  });
  
  // Create notification
  if (assignedTo) {
    await createLeaveNotification(assignedTo.id, docRef.id, leaveData, dept);
  }
}
```
